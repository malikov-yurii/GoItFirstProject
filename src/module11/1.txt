CANNON BALL, The prairie is seething. 
Work crews are plugging ahead on the 1,170-mile Dakota Access oil pipeline, 
inching closer and closer to a river crossing that activists view as a critical juncture in their monthslong fight 
against a $3.7 billion project that they say will 
threaten water supplies and that Native Americans say violates 
their right to sacred land.
Last week, clashes erupted between 
lines of law enforcement officers and protesters. The air 
was filled with pepper spray and black smoke from burning tires. 
The authorities arrested 142 people during what local sheriffs denounced as a riot and 
protesters said was a peaceful demonstration.
For months now, 
Mekasi Horinek and Deputy Jon Moll have 
lived these demonstrations, day in and day out.
